Why is this thing so fast? The only case that uses O(n) approach is next free block search function. When you call allocate(), it takes index of free block, and searches for next free block starting from that index. It works, because free() always keeps track of pointer to the *first* free block. Also, free() uses O(1) algorithm, so every run takes constant time. These are main features of library - insanely fast free algorithm and small header!

Also, we made "revolutional" feature - our pool allocator is expandable, like any C++ storage (std::vector, etc.)! It supports two policies - NoReallocations, and OffsetRealloc. NoReallocations will return nullptr if pool is exhausted, and OffsetRealloc will try to extend pool.

## Installation
1. Download header [hpool.h](hpool.hpp)
2. Include it to your source file.
3. ...use?

## Building tests and benchmarks
There is a single test (yes) and some benchmarks. To build, run this:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
./tests # Run test(s)
./bench # Run benchmark (please, be patient)
```

## Usage

### Preparation
Create pool object. You can select NoReallocations policy:
```cpp
hpool::HPool<T, hpool::ReallocationPolicy::NoReallocations> pool{32};
```
or OffsetRealloc policy, for expandable storage:
```cpp
hpool::HPool<T, hpool::ReallocationPolicy::OffsetRealloc> pool{32};
```
where T is a target type, and 32 is a max pool size (in number of elements of type T).

### Use
#### Allocate memory:
```cpp
auto ptr = pool.allocate();
```
`ptr` has type hpool::Ptr<T, hpool::ReallocationPolicy::<your_policy>, i recommend creating a macro for these types.

#### Free memory:
```cpp
pool.free(ptr);
```

#### Get total count of elements:
```cpp
uint32_t count = pool.size();
```

#### Get count of allocated elements:
```cpp
uint32_t count = pool.allocated();
```


## Benchmarks

I compared this library to boost's object_pool using my own benchmarking lib called [HBench](https://github.com/randommfs/HBench). You can find it in [bench](bench) directory in project root.

**Pools has been tested in different scopes, on 524288 elements. Compiled with -O3. CPU - AMD FX-8350 4GHz. Test results are average from 3 iterations.**  
**Every test has two variants - on size_t and 3-dimensional vector, which has 3 double values in it.**
